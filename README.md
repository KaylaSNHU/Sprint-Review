## CS-250 Sprint Review & Retrospective Artifact  

### Reflection on Essential Questions

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them in a program?**  
I start by turning raw stakeholder wishes into small, testable *user stories* framed around real value (“As a traveler, I want a price-range filter so I can see trips I can afford”). Writing stories forces me to uncover acceptance criteria up front, so developers know exactly when the feature is “done.” In our SNHU Travel sprint, breaking the broad “View Travel Packages” epic into five INVEST-ready stories let us demo a working slideshow by Day 10, instead of waiting for a monolithic release.

**How do I approach developing programs, and which Agile processes will I keep using?**  
My default is incremental: plan a thin slice of value, build it inside a two-week Sprint, and show it to users at the Sprint Review. I rely on three core Scrum practices to stay on track Daily Stand-ups for real time coordination, Backlog Refinement to keep work INVEST-ready, and a Retrospective to tighten the loop every Sprint. Automated CI tests run on every pull request, guarding quality without slowing velocity. I’ll bring that trio (plus CI) to every future project because they shorten feedback cycles and surface issues early.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
A good teammate practices *transparent communication* and *shared ownership*. In our pilot sprint, pairing developers with testers caught UI defects days sooner, and a numbered email to the Product Owner let us clarify three open questions in one reply instead of an endless thread. I aim to replicate that behavior speak up in Daily Scrums, keep work visible on the Kanban board, help remove blockers even outside my specialty, and give constructive feedback in Retrospectives, because it turns a group of specialists into a true cross-functional team.
